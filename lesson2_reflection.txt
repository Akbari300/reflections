.get file to keep track of version-control.



how is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
what value do you think it offer?

staging area is a middle stage between working directory and repository 
which we add file to be committed together. it offer to add file and remove file
from committing together. 


how you can use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
the staging area provide the space to add our new changes file before commit to repository. 
before commit we can use the command (git diff) to see the new changes and between working directory and staging area, and also we can use (git diff --stagged) to see the changes between the staging area and repository to make sure we commit per logical change.
