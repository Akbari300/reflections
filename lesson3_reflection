when would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your file local?
whenever more than one people work in same project simulitunitly, and to share their work online and keep all the changes update, github
is used for same purpose. 



why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay-up-to-date with remote repository? 
because when working on project with many peopel simitinuesly, some time we bring small changes and make sure that is change is correct for next step, using gitHub. 




Descibe the difference between fork, clone and branches, when would you use one instead of another? 
fork is used for coping fron one GitHub account to another GitHub account, clone is used when we want to copy from GitHub account to local computer. and branch is used for branching.
